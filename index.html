            <h3>Overall Assessment and Recommendations:</h3>
            <p>Nikhila Vutukuri presented a strong background in business analysis with substantial experience in the banking sector, showcasing her skills in SQL, data analysis, and project management tools like JIRA. Her communication skills are commendable, though there is room for improvement in clarity and structure when discussing technical topics. Nikhila's experience aligns well with the job requirements, but there are areas where she could better demonstrate her capabilities, particularly in innovation, learning agility, and adaptability. We recommend further exploration of her potential in these areas, possibly through a follow-up interview focusing on aspects of creativity, risk and compliance experience, and her approach to continuous learning and improvement.</p>
